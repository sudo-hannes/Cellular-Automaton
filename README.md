# Cellular-Automaton

A Unity project used to simulate and demonstrate Cellular Automata

In this project two types Cellular Automata are simulated:

1. Game Of Life (sudohannes)

- This implementation focuses on simulating John Conway's Game of Life.
- It also contains a directory of existing structures discovered in the Game of Life, which can be copied into the simulation.

2. Langton's Ant (EYssel)

- This implementation focuses on simulating Langton's Ant.
- The simulation allows for creation of rules through input such as "LRRL" which will alter the behaviour of the ant to create interesting patterns
